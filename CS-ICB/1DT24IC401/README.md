📄 Project Description:
The Tic Tac Toe Game is a simple, two-player console-based game developed in Java. It allows two users to play the classic 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game in turns. The application checks for valid moves, determines the winner, and handles draw situations. It is an excellent beginner-level project that showcases the use of arrays, loops, conditional statements, and basic game logic.

🎯 Objectives:
Build a playable version of Tic Tac Toe.

Implement turn-based input for two players.

Check and declare game outcomes: win, draw, or continue playing.

Practice key Java programming concepts like 2D arrays, control flow, and input handling.

🧠 Key Features:
3x3 game board displayed in the console.

Two-player gameplay: Player X and Player O.

Validates user input (avoids overwriting occupied cells).

Detects win conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals.

Detects draw if the board is full and no winner.

Clean and readable user interface in the terminal.

🔧 Technology Used:
Language: Java

Development Environment: Any Java IDE or simple text editor (e.g., VS Code, Eclipse, IntelliJ, Notepad++)

Compiler: javac (Java Compiler)

🔍 How It Works:
A 3x3 board is initialized using a 2D array.

Players take turns entering their moves (row and column).

The program checks:

If the move is valid

If the current player has won

If the board is full (resulting in a draw)

The game ends with a message declaring the winner or a draw.

🏁 Conclusion:
This project helps reinforce the fundamentals of Java programming, including arrays, loops, conditionals, and input/output. It is a solid starting point for anyone learning game development or practicing object-oriented programming basics.
