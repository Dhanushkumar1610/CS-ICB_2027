# Banking System

This project is a simple banking system implemented in Python. It allows users to perform core banking operations such as:

- **Account Management**: Create, view, and manage bank accounts.
- **Transactions**: Deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds between accounts.
- **Transaction History**: View detailed transaction records with timestamps.
- **Passbook Generation**: Generate a formatted passbook for account activity.

### Key Features:
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Encapsulates account properties and behaviors for modularity and reusability.
- **Data Persistence**: Uses file handling to save and load account and transaction data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A menu-driven interface for easy interaction.
- **Error Handling**: Prevents invalid transactions, such as overdrafts or transfers to non-existent accounts.
- **Unique Account Numbers**: Automatically generates unique account numbers for each user.
