The FlashcardApp is a simple Java program that allows users to create flashcards, test their knowledge with those flashcards, and view their results. It provides a menu with options to add flashcards, take a quiz, and check the number of correct and incorrect answers. The user can enter a question and its corresponding answer, and then later test their memory by answering the questions. The program tracks and displays the number of correct and incorrect responses after the quiz.
