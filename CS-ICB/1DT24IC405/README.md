### Description of the Traffic Management System in Java

The traffic management system in Java simulates the functioning of a traffic light and the behavior of vehicles in response to the traffic light’s state. It models the essential elements of traffic control at an intersection, including the management of traffic lights and vehicles, with basic logic to control vehicle movements based on the light's color.

#### Key Components:

1. **Traffic Light (TrafficLight Class)**:
   - The **TrafficLight** class manages the state of the traffic light (Red, Yellow, Green).
   - It starts in the **Red** state, signaling vehicles to stop. The light cycles through the states (Red → Green → Yellow → Red) at regular intervals.
   - The state transitions every 3 seconds, and the current state is displayed in the console each time it changes.
   
2. **Vehicle (Vehicle Class)**:
   - The **Vehicle** class simulates a vehicle at an intersection, with each vehicle having an ID (for identification).
   - Vehicles start in a stopped state (since the light is red at the start).
   - When the light turns **green**, the vehicle starts moving. When the light turns **red** or **yellow**, the vehicle stops.
   - The system prints messages to the console, indicating when vehicles are moving or stopping based on the traffic light state.

3. **LightState Enum**:
   - The **LightState** enum defines the different states of the traffic light: **RED**, **YELLOW**, and **GREEN**.
   - These states control the flow of traffic, with **RED** instructing vehicles to stop, **GREEN** allowing vehicles to move, and **YELLOW** warning vehicles to prepare to stop.

4. **Timer for Light Cycle**:
   - A **Timer** object is used to manage the timing of the light's state changes. It triggers a task at regular intervals (every 3 seconds) to change the light's state and control the vehicles' movements.
   - The state transitions follow this cycle: **RED → GREEN → YELLOW → RED**, ensuring regular changes in the traffic light state.

5. **Simulation**:
   - The system simulates the traffic light's behavior and the movement of two vehicles for 20 seconds.
   - Every 3 seconds, the light changes its state, and the vehicles' actions (either stopping or moving) are displayed based on the light's state.
   - After 20 seconds, the simulation ends, and the system stops the timer.

#### Workflow:

1. Initially, the traffic light is red, and all vehicles are stopped.
2. The traffic light turns **green**, and the vehicles start moving.
3. After a short period, the light turns **yellow**, signaling vehicles to prepare to stop.
4. When the light turns **red**, vehicles stop again.
5. The cycle repeats, simulating the behavior of a traffic intersection with changing lights and vehicle responses.

#### Use Cases:

- **Traffic Flow Management**: This system could be extended to handle more complex scenarios involving multiple lanes and traffic sensors that monitor the traffic density at different times of the day.
- **Simulating Intersection Behavior**: This model helps simulate the flow of traffic in intersections for testing purposes, demonstrating how changes in traffic light states affect vehicle movement.
- **Real-time Traffic Control**: The concept could be expanded to include real-time data, such as the number of vehicles waiting at a red light, to optimize traffic light timing and reduce congestion.

#### Potential Enhancements:

- **Multiple Intersections**: The system could be expanded to manage traffic lights for multiple intersections and coordinate the timing of the traffic lights to minimize waiting times for vehicles.
- **Sensor Integration**: The simulation could incorporate sensors that detect the presence of vehicles or pedestrians and adjust traffic light timing accordingly.
- **Adaptive Traffic Control**: Instead of fixed intervals for light changes, the system could adjust the light cycles based on real-time traffic conditions, such as the number of waiting vehicles or traffic flow patterns.

In summary, this traffic management system provides a basic yet functional simulation of a traffic light and vehicle interaction, illustrating how traffic lights manage the flow of traffic through an intersection. It can be enhanced for more complex and realistic traffic management applications.
