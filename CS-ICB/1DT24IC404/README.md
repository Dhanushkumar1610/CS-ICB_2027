### Description of the Number Guessing Game

The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple interactive console game designed to challenge players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game is suitable for players of all ages and serves as an excellent introduction to programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

#### Game Overview

1. **Objective**: The primary goal of the game is for the player to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100. The player must make guesses and receive feedback until they correctly identify the number.

2. **Gameplay Mechanics**:
   - Upon starting the game, a random number is generated by the program.
   - The player is prompted to enter their guess.
   - After each guess, the program provides feedback:
     - If the guess is lower than the target number, the player is informed that their guess is "too low."
     - If the guess is higher than the target number, the player is informed that their guess is "too high."
     - If the guess matches the target number, the player is congratulated and informed of the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.

3. **User  Interaction**: The game is played through a console interface, where the player inputs their guesses. The program reads the input, processes it, and outputs the corresponding feedback.

4. **End of Game**: The game continues until the player successfully guesses the number. Once the correct guess is made, the game concludes, and the player is given the option to play again (if implemented).

#### Features

- **Random Number Generation**: The game utilizes a random number generator to select a number within the specified range (1 to 100).
- **Input Validation**: The game checks if the player's guess is within the valid range and prompts them to enter a valid number if it is not.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: The game provides immediate feedback on each guess, enhancing the interactive experience.
- **Attempt Tracking**: The game keeps track of the number of attempts the player makes to guess the correct number, adding a competitive element to the game.

#### Educational Value

The Number Guessing Game serves as an excellent project for beginner and intermediate programmers. It helps reinforce fundamental programming concepts, including:

- **Control Structures**: Understanding loops and conditional statements.
- **User  Input Handling**: Learning how to read and validate user input.
- **Randomness**: Utilizing random number generation to create dynamic gameplay experiences.
- **Game Logic**: Implementing basic game mechanics and flow.

Overall, the Number Guessing Game is a fun and engaging way to practice programming skills while providing an enjoyable experience for players. It can be further enhanced with additional features, such as difficulty levels, score tracking, or a graphical user interface, making it a versatile project for developers looking to expand their skills.
